### Cross-validation of the operation of photovoltaic systems connected to the grid in extreme conditions of the highlands above 3800 meters above sea level
Abstract: Climatological factors influence the performanceof grid-connectedphotovoltaic systems(PV). Thesefactors vary according to the altitude above sea level. The present work aimed to compare theperformance of a PVwith a string inverter(StringPV)versusa PVwith DC-DC poweroptimizers(DC DC PV)at 3800meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) undernatural conditions. For this purpose, two PVof 3kW each were installed, and their performance was measured under the IEC 62053 standard. Then multiparametric regression models were applied for each of them. TheresultswereValidatethrough linearity, normality  of  the  error  terms,  correlation,  autocorrelation and homoscedasticity.Subsequently,thecross-validation of both models hasperformed,whoseresults showed that the DC-DC PVhas a better resultin 6.09% over the String PV model, so we conclude that the DC-DC Pv converter performs better at 3800m.a.s.l.
